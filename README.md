flot-selection: Selection plugin for Flot
=========================================

* Author: flot developers

This is a small modification of qking's modified Flot Selection file found here: https://github.com/cclibs/flot-selection. This modification simply removes the need to select either/or on touch/click, and instead makes it touch/click agnostic. It uses a global variable to track which is ongoing and can switch at-will between them.

This is my first fork, so I hope I did it right.
